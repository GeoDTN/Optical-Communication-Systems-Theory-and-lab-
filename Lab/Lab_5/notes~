rayleigh 1

Exercise 1
-use simplified equation at pag 6
-eta is [1/m]
-translate alpha in linear units!!! has to be in [1/m] -> 0.2 [dB/Km]

Exercise 2

Exercise 3
evaluate the spectrum at the end of the fiber

Exercise 4
For -58.23 dB of Rayleigh scattering coefficient, the BER starts exceedings 10^-9 dB.

Exercise 5/6
there is no dispersion! if the pulses are overlapped they remain overlapped:
N.B.: the bit sequence is different from the one in the parameters!!!
Just compare the results.



only signals with the same polarization are amplified

max raman gain

1st when they are parallel
then rotate +-90Â° so they are orthogonal

Brilluoin_1

Brilluoin_2

es 8
enter the numerical value in watts (linear units)

no more than 10 dBm of reflected power --> change phase to achieve it
