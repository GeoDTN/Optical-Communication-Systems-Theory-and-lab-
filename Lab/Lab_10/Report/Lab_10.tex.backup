\section*{Setup 2}
The maximum laser output power of the optical power meter is 10 dBm. To avoid link damage we implement an attenuation of 6 dB,
so the effective output power is 4 dBm.

\subsection*{Method 1}
The laser wavelength is $\lambda=1552.52$ nm.
The optical power measured after the multiplexer is $P=-1.30$ dBm.

To measure the insertion losses of the connectors we loop the input and the output of the optical power meter.
The measured power is 2.61 dBm, so the insertion loss is 1.39 dB.

\subsection*{Method 2}
For this measurement we have inserted optical coupler of 70\%-30\% power divider.
The measured power at the receiver, for the 1550 nm link, is $P=-19.67$ dBm.

\newpage
\section*{Setup 3}
We measure the throughput/BER of the 1310 nm link, as a function of the attenuation.
In the Figure \ref{throughput} are reported the measured values.
We can observe that the throughput is almost constant until an attenuation value of 9 dB, then it immediately falls.
